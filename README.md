# Portfolio

This is a working version of my [portfolio site](https://beta.dashengz.com/).

### Development

Clone the repo and run `npm install` and `npm install --only=dev`

Make sure you have `gulp-cli` installed. If not, run `sudo npm install gulp-cli -g`

Modify the src files and run `gulp` when finished.

The production files will be generated in the `./dist` folder.
